# The Village — Loam's living demonstration

Four (and counting) federated Loam stores, a cast of villagers, and a browser dashboard —
a small society that exercises everything Loam claims, end to end, over real HTTP. It began
as an ephemeral field test; it graduated (Myk, 2026-07-09) into a **living demonstration
that grows with every PR**: the loop's stage 7 (see `../CLAUDE.md`) extends the village to
exercise each new behavior, and logs it in the ledger below.

Nothing here is product, and nothing here gates the build. `homes/` (sqlite stores and
operator seeds) is untracked and disposable — delete it and the phases rebuild the world.

## The cast

| identity    | who                                          | writes on      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Wren**    | gardener; keeps the village commons          | commons        |
| **Miles**   | cinephile; logs every screening              | reel, commons  |
| **Odile**   | beekeeper; keeps a frank apiary journal      | hive, commons  |
| **Petra**   | newcomer; arrives mid-saga                   | commons (late) |
| **Mallory** | no standing anywhere; supplies the adversary | nothing, ever  |

## The stores

- **commons** (:4401) — the social graph: `Person`, `Circle` (friends expanded through
  Person). Registered via the **CLI**.
- **reel** (:4402) — Miles's screening log: `Film`, `Screening` (the schema-evolution target),
  `FilmNight`, its own `Person`. Registered via **HTTP /register**. Pulls the commons.
- **hive** (:4403) — Odile's apiary: `Colony` (with frank `grumbles`), `Gathering`. Registered
  via **MCP**. Federates through an **offered lens** — the grumbles never leave home.
- **almanac** (:4404) — the confluence: pulls everyone, writes nothing, serves `Dossier`,
  `Presence`, `TrustedDossier`, `GuardedDossier` — one gathered ground, many lenses. The
  dashboard reads here.

Person entities are the only shared vocabulary; everything else composes by federation.

## Run it

```sh
node _testing/phase0.mjs   # groundwork: homes, operators, registrations (all 3 surfaces)
node _testing/phase1.mjs   # …through phase8.mjs — each phase is a runnable act with checks
node _testing/village.mjs  # the living village: all stores + pulse + simulator + dashboard
                           #   → watch it at http://127.0.0.1:4400
```

`PLAN.md` is the original saga's tracking document (51/51 checks) plus field notes — the finds
there (resolution eliding the anchor pointer, `_hex` covering the whole view, the byAuthorRank
tie surprise) drove real Loam and rhizomatic changes.

## What it demonstrates — the ledger

_(one entry per PR that grew the village; newest last)_

- **The founding saga** (steps 0–9 era, PLAN.md phases 0–7, 51/51): registration through all
  three surfaces; capabilities and their refusals; SSE snapshots/patches with hex chains; many
  schemas over one ground; live schema evolution under a watching subscriber with old/new
  shapes served concurrently; byte-identical replay of old ground under old law; lensed
  federation (grumbles stay home); the trust duel (pick-latest falls for Mallory's forgery,
  byAuthorRank does not); four-store convergence audits; cold restarts; the adversarial sweep.
- **PR #17 — rhizomatic 0.2.0 lenses** (phase8.mjs): `TrustedDossier` upgraded to
  `chain[byAuthorRank, byTimestamp]` — it now shows the trusted author's **latest** word
  (the founding saga's field-note bug, fixed by the substrate we asked for). New
  `GuardedDossier` on the almanac built from `governedGatherBody(operator)`: Mallory
  **strikes** Wren's bio delta by federation — the plain `Dossier` goes blank (the heckler's
  veto, visible), while `GuardedDossier` keeps the bio (stranger strikes are inert under the
  governed lens). The village simulator gains the strike act; the dashboard's trust duel now
  distinguishes forged-value from erased-value attacks.
- **PR #18 — trust is data**: Mallory's arc grows two acts. After Wren heals the record, the
  almanac's operator **declares a roster with one delta** (the villagers and the three peer
  operators) — and Mallory's very next forgery **bounces at the door** (`accepted: 0`,
  narrated in the event log); then the almanac reopens, an aggregator by choice. The same
  roster that gates the door is readable as an eval-side lens (`trustRosterPred`) — one
  source of truth, demonstrated live.
- **PR #19 — normalization, and THE GAUNTLET**: the village gains its fifth store — `cinelog`
  (:4405), Sasha's app, speaking a dialect no villager knows (`film_watched`/`viewer`/`on`).
  The open almanac pulls it whole; one operator-signed **translation spec** renders every
  entry into the village's tongue; and Wren's dossier now shows a screening **recorded by a
  stranger's app**, provenance visible in the resolved view itself (`origin: cinelog`,
  `translates: <source id>`). The roster flipped mid-run and the pulse refused the stranger;
  flipped back and the backlog normalized (phase9.mjs, 4/4). In the living village, every
  pulse now ends with a translation pass, narrated in the event log. The arc's thesis,
  demonstrated: anyone may write, in any tongue — the reader decides everything, and
  understands more than it was told.
- **PR #22 — cold storage: THE FIRE** (phase10.mjs, 4/4): the almanac now keeps a **seed
  vault** (`homes/almanac/vault` — an `ArchiveBackend` behind a `MirrorBackend`): every
  append lands hot and cold in one motion, one file per delta, named by its content address.
  The living village gains the fire act (every 24th beat): the almanac's sqlite **burns to
  the ground mid-story** — and the reopen heals from the vault before the gateway reads.
  Watched live: `🔥 FIRE at the almanac — 187 deltas of hot store, burning to the ground` →
  `🌱 the seed vault replants the almanac — 187 deltas restored, every dossier intact`; the
  dossier watchers resubscribe, the pulse resumes, the dashboard barely blinks. Phase 10's
  quiet perfection: the bio that survived the fire word-for-word was Mallory's old forgery —
  the vault preserves *everything* and leaves judgment to the lenses, exactly as a store of
  record must.
